      <p class="intro"><b>Grand Admiral Thrawn</b>, also known by his native name <b>Mitth'raw'nuruodo</b>, was a Chiss military commander who served the Galactic Empire.  Renowned as the most brilliant strategist in galactic history, Thrawn rose through the ranks to become the only alien grand admiral, despite the anti-alien sentiments that were common in the Empire.  He studied the artistic works of civilizations he fought against to better understand them, giving him an ability to predict his opponents' moves that bordered on the supernatural.  Unlike commanders like Darth Vader, Thrawn was greatly beloved by his subordinates—such as his right-hand man, Captain Gilad Pellaeon—choosing to inspire loyalty rather than rule through fear.  Thrawn despised the politics and infighting that plagued the Empire, and was willing to set aside his own glory in favor of the greater good for the Empire.  On occasion, he was even known to defy Emperor Palpatine himself by refusing to attack Palpatine's targets when he knew that he lacked the resources to pull it off.  Despite his loyalty to the Empire, Thrawn was not inherently evil; ultimately, his end goal was to fortify the galaxy under the Empire's rule in preparation for an imminent invasion of the extra-galactic Yuuzhan Vong aliens.  After the Empire was fragmented with the deaths of Palpatine and Vader at the Battle of Endor, Thrawn emerged as the last surviving grand admiral.  Armed with the legendary <i>Katana</i> fleet and with help from the insane Dark Jedi clone Joruus C'baoth, Thrawn returned from the Unknown Regions to destroy the fledgling New Republic and restore the Empire to its former glory.</p>
